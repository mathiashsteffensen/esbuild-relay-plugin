# esbuild-relay-plugin

An esbuild plugin to transform tagged GraphQL template literals for Relay. Heavily inspired by babel-plugin-relay.

Features
* Replaces `graphql` tagged template literals with imports to the artifacts generated by `relay-compiler`
* Supports CommonJS and ESM module formats

Caveat
* This plugin uses string replacements and does not parse the source code. This means it will try to compile GraphQL literals even if they are commented out. If that does not fit your workflow, you'll need to use ESBuild + babel + babel-plugin-relay.

## Installation
### Using NPM
```bash
npm install -D esbuild-relay-plugin
```

### Using yarn
```bash
yarn add -D esbuild-relay-plugin
```

## Usage
```typescript
import esbuild from "esbuild"
import { EsbuildRelayPlugin } from "esbuild-relay-plugin"

esbuild.build({
    // ...other options,
    plugins: [
      new EsbuildRelayPlugin(),
    ]
})
```

## Acknowledgements
This plugin is based on the official [babel-plugin-relay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-relay).
